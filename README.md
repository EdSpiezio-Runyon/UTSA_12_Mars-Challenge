# UTSA Module 12: Mars-Challenge

## Background
### You’re now ready to take on the full web-scraping and data analysis project for the mission to Mars. You’ve learned to identify HTML elements on a page, identify their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. You’ve also learned to scrape various types of information. These include HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.

### As you work on this Challenge, remember that you’re strengthening the same core skills that you’ve been developing until now: collecting data, organizing and storing data, analyzing data, and then visually communicating your insights.

## What You're Creating
### This new assignment consists of two technical products. You will submit the following deliverables:

### Deliverable 1 (part_1_mars_news.ipynb): Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. Optionally export the data into a JSON file, saved as mars_list.txt.

### Deliverable 2 (part_2_mars_weather.ipynb): Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table. Output table is saved under output_data as mars_weather_data.csv.
